    <h3>How to Cook the Perfect Hot Dog</h3>  
      <p>The best hot dog means knowing the perfect way to cook a hot dog, whether you roast, grill, simmer, microwave, or turn it over an open campfire.
         Here’s everything you need to know.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>     
      <ul>
        <li>1 hot dog (or as many more as you need)</li>
        <li>1 hot dog bun (or as many more as you need)</li>
        <li>yellow mustard</li>
        <li>Other condiments, as desired (pickle relish, ketchup, sport peppers, sauerkraut, onions, cheese, and so forth)</li>
      </ul>
    <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare the hot dogs: Preheat grill to 500°F. Using a pairing knife, cut small 45° slits along the length of the wieners, marking every half-inch and going about halfway deep. Transfer the wieners onto the hot grill and cook for about 5 minutes, turning occasionally to ensure they’re uniformly cooked. Use wieners in one or more of the following ways:</li>
        <li>For the Tex Mex: Open buns on work surface and spoon equal amounts of corn salsa onto each, spreading it out evenly. Place one cooked wiener onto each bun. Sprinkle with Monterey Jack then add slices of grilled jalapeños. Place prepared hot dogs into an oven-safe casserole or rectangular baking pan. Transfer to preheated 250°F oven and bake for 10-15 minutes or until cheese has melted and bun is toasted. Combine mayo, lime juice and cilantro and add to hot dogs as garnish. Serve immediately.</li>
        <li>For the County Fare: Open buns on work surface and line each side with pickle slices. Place one cooked wiener onto each bun. Add a helping of chili on top of each, spreading it across the hot dog. Sprinkle with cheese. Place prepared hot dogs into an oven-safe casserole or rectangular baking pan. Transfer to preheated 250°F oven and bake for 10-15 minutes or until cheese has melted and bun is toasted. Garnish with ketchup, mustard and relish. Serve immediately.</li>
        <li>For the Pizza Dog: Open buns on work surface. Add a helping of pizza sauce onto each, spreading it across. Place one cooked wiener onto each bun. Sprinkle a small handful of olives on one side of hot dog. Add some of the sautéed vegetables across the other. Sprinkle with cheese. Place prepared hot dogs into an oven-safe casserole or rectangular baking pan. Transfer to preheated 250°F oven and bake for 10-15 minutes or until cheese has melted and bun is toasted. Garnish with chopped parsley. Serve immediately.</li>
